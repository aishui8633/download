Prompter
   Prompter is my gift to the MidJourney AI creative community. It is a Google spreadsheet and cloud database to assist and ease prompt design, as well as a detailed Visual Notebook. The interface is simple and straightforward for new users, but also thorough and comprehensive enough for the advanced crowd.
  Prompter offers an easy to understand design, and contains a cloud database of descriptors, artists, movies, lighting, and so much more. Get everything you need in a clean user interface without even scrolling, and never type :: or -- ever again. 
   Prompter (the spreadsheet and this notebook) is a passion project for me, and I plan to keep things updated and growing as MidJoureny itself evolves. It takes a lot of time and work, so I give a big thank you to all of the support of large and small donations. It is because of you that I am able to stay on the platform and bring you more tools and content.

Visual Notebook
   The Prompter Visual Notebook is a new work in progress, but already quite organized and extensive enough that I hope you find it to be a great creative resource. This is not an official guide, and I am not affiliated with MidJourney in any way, just love their AI, however you can check out their user guide HERE as well. This is a collection of visual examples from the Prompter database. All of my tests use the same simple prompt “a city street” because I assume the AI was likely trained on a lot of street images, and also a scene like that is very flexible with descriptors. Of course, some artists or terms might display better results with a portrait or something, but hey, you can’t have it all! I used a 16:9 aspect ratio as a standard (but be aware that compositions can change drastically with different ratios), and used the same seed for consistency. These tests were all done on the latest version 3 of MidJoureny.
   The Visual Notebook is split up into sections based on the organization in Prompter. Below are bookmarks to each of the sections. As this is a work in progress, feel free to CONTACT me if you have any ideas, see issues, or if I made some stupid mistake (as I tend to do!).
